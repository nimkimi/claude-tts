@echo off
rem Windows launcher for the Sonari plugin hook.
rem
rem Lets hooks/hooks.json's "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/sonari-hook <Event>" resolve
rem to this .cmd on Windows (via PATHEXT) instead of the extensionless shebang
rem script, which cmd/PowerShell cannot execute directly. Runs the Python hook
rem entrypoint windowless (no console flash on every hook). The hook payload
rem arrives on stdin; sonari-hook self-bootstraps sys.path, so no PYTHONPATH.
rem
rem A hook must never fail LOUDLY (it would interrupt Claude Code), so we always
rem exit 0. But it must not fail SILENTLY either: a missing/wrong pythonw used to
rem mute Sonari with no trace (stderr went to nul). So we resolve a windowless
rem interpreter (pythonw, else the py launcher's windowless `pyw -3`) and append
rem stderr to ~/.sonari/hook.log for diagnosis instead of discarding it (M10).
