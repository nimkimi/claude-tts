"""macOS TTS backend — wraps the `say` command, with optional Kokoro neural
voices routed through the portable engine and played via ``afplay``.

A Kokoro voice (af_heart, af_nicole, ...) is synthesized by the shared
``sonari.kokoro`` engine to WAV bytes and played by spawning ``afplay`` on a
temp file; everything else goes to the native ``say`` command. Both paths return
a proc-like handle (.wait/.terminate/.poll/.returncode) so the Speaker's
cancel/interrupt, earcon mixing, and temp-file cleanup behave identically. This
mirrors the Windows backend post-#42 (issue #41) — additive, no Windows change.

NOTE: ``_TMP_PREFIX`` / ``_sweep_stale_wavs`` deliberately duplicate the Windows
backend's (windows/tts.py) rather than cross-importing a sibling platform module;
the prefix is byte-identical so either backend's startup sweep reclaims the
other's crash-leaked WAVs. A shared helper would touch the Windows file (out of
scope for this macOS-only change).
