"""Windows OneCore TTS backend via PyWinRT — synthesize + winsound playback.

OneCore (Windows.Media.SpeechSynthesis) synthesizes a WAV stream; we play it
with stdlib ``winsound`` from a temp file. The earlier MediaPlayer-based
playback crashed the process with a native access violation after ~80 utterances
(a PyWinRT MediaPlayer fragility — synthesis is fine, playback is not), which is
the daemon-death bug. ``winsound`` is COM-free, in-process, and stress-survives.

To fit Sonari's say_runner contract (the Speaker orchestrates a proc-like
object), run() returns a _TtsHandle whose .wait(timeout)/.terminate()/
.returncode mimic subprocess.Popen.

WINDOWS-only: every winrt.* / winsound import is LAZY (inside methods) so this
module imports cleanly on macOS/Linux for the mock test suite. "Working" under
the mocks is NOT a claim that real OneCore playback works — only Windows is.

Requirements (Windows only):
    pip install winrt-runtime winrt-Windows.Media.SpeechSynthesis \
                winrt-Windows.Storage.Streams

NOTE: winsound is a single output channel for speech. Earcons are played in a
separate windowless helper process (see earcon.py) so their audio session mixes
with speech (shared-mode) rather than cutting it.
