# Sonari SP5 Catch-up Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Add the `catch_up` verb — a spoken host-LLM summary of what happened in a piled session while the user was away. An instant deterministic ack carrying ground-truth facts, then (~5–10 s later) a summary voiced in a distinct voice at a sentence boundary; hearing it to completion burns the pile like an informed skip. Any failure falls to a deterministic extractive digest. Host-CLI auth only (no API key ever).

**Architecture:** A new daemon-side summarizer seam (`HostSummarizer` protocol + `ClaudeCliSummarizer` adapter) `Popen`s the user's own `claude -p` with the transcript slice on stdin and the API-key env scrubbed. Preparation runs on one fire-and-forget worker thread that touches NO daemon state — it calls only `summarizer.summarize(slice_text)` and posts an internal `catchup_result` protocol message to a `queue.Queue` mailbox drained at the top of the speak loop, so every state change happens on the daemon loop via the normal handler registry (tests drive it directly via `handle_message`). The press captures a full bundle (`self._catchup`) — target, folder, pinned `slice_end`, deterministic digest, slice text — that survives SESSION_END (daemon state, not sessions/history). The render is a three-item sequence (frame main-voice + body summary-voice + tail main-voice) tagged with a `render_id`; the frontier burns to the pinned `slice_end` only when the whole sequence completes, and any mid-render cut suppresses the burn.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.9+ daemon, stdlib only (`subprocess`, `threading`, `queue`, `tempfile`), pytest. No new third-party dependency. DI via injected `popen` callable (the `kokoro_provision` pattern). Run the suite with `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q`.

## Global Constraints

- **Agent-neutrality:** no host-specific shape crosses the adapter seam into protocol/history/core. Core asks one question — "summarize this slice, or fail detectably." `hooks_entry.py` (the inbound hook-process adapter) stays untouched; the summarizer is a NEW daemon-side seam.
- **Spoken-grammar principles** (`2026-07-16-sonari-whereami-grammar-v2.md`) bind every new spoken string and the narrator prompt: sentence boundaries are the only rate-proof prosody (each spoken unit ends in a period); a role word sits adjacent to every number ("{N} items"); never leave a high-stakes fact as a standalone clippable landmark (the decision fact rides an inline tail, never a bare "Decision:").
- **Env-scrub:** the `claude -p` child environment is a copy of the daemon env with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` AND `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` removed — the billing trap (a stray key silently flips subscription OAuth to metered API billing). This is the single most important line in the feature and has its own dedicated test.
- **Explicit press only, one in flight globally, 30 s hard timeout** with the child process group killed on expiry; stdin written then closed promptly. SP5 fires no automatic summaries. A press while one is in flight is a pure cancel (never starts a new one).
- **All state changes on the daemon loop.** The worker thread never mutates daemon state (not history, streams, sessions, or `self._catchup` fields the loop reads for rendering). It only calls the summarizer and posts to the mailbox.
- **Guards green at every commit and never weakened:** the 6 concurrency/monotonicity guards must pass at every commit; existing tests are updated for new pile semantics, never weakened.
- **Suite green at every commit:** `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` passes after every task's final step.
- **Conventional commits, NO AI/tool/session mentions ever** in any commit message or code comment.
- **Every new `MsgType` is added to `tests/test_protocol.py`'s completeness guard** (`test_msgtype_defines_no_extra_string_constants`, line 95 — the strict one) AND to `assert_complete(...)` in `src/sonari/daemon/__init__.py` (empirically required — SP4 T6 lesson).
- **Build-entry gate:** this build starts only after the OWNER runs the §4 smoke tests on his machine (his quota, his go). Plan tasks NEVER run a live `claude -p`; all tests use the injected fake summarizer.
- **No result caching, no mid-prep progress ticks, no auto-triggers** in v1 (out of scope, §14 of the spec).
