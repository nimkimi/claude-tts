# Sonari — Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2026-07-18_

Sonari is a macOS accessibility plugin for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) that reads
Claude Code's output aloud so you can work eyes-free. This policy explains exactly what it
does — and does not do — with your data.

## The short version

**Sonari runs entirely on your own Mac. It does not collect, transmit, sell, or share any of
your data.** There are no servers, no accounts, no telemetry, no analytics, no crash
reporting, and no third-party services.

## What Sonari processes

To speak Claude Code's output, Sonari receives the text that Claude Code passes to it through
plugin hooks — assistant prose, the options in multiple-choice questions, plan text, and
permission-prompt actions. That text is:

- processed **in memory** on your machine,
- handed to the built-in macOS `say` command to be spoken, and
- stored **only on your machine**: since the persistence update, Sonari keeps
  session text in `~/.sonari/state.json` so unheard speech survives daemon
  restarts. It is never transmitted.

Sonari's components talk to each other only over a **local socket** on your machine. Nothing
Sonari handles ever leaves your computer.

## What Sonari stores on your machine

Sonari keeps a few small local files under `~/.sonari/` (and LaunchAgent files under
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/`):

- `config.json` — your preferences (voice, speech rate, verbosity).
- `keymap.json` and `hotkeyd.resolved.json` — your global-hotkey bindings.
- `install.json` — local file paths and the install timestamp.
- `state.json` — **session content**: the text of what Sonari has spoken or has
  yet to speak, kept so your unheard backlog survives restarts. Local only.
- `*.log` — operational/diagnostic output (startup and errors). Sonari is **not designed to
  record your session content** in these logs.

None of these files are transmitted off your machine.

## Optional diagnostic capture (off by default)

For troubleshooting, Sonari has an **opt-in** capture mode that is **disabled unless you
explicitly enable it** by setting the `SONARI_CAPTURE` environment variable to a folder path.
When enabled, it writes the raw hook payloads it receives (which include session content) to
that folder **on your machine**, to help diagnose problems. It is local-only and never
transmitted. Leave `SONARI_CAPTURE` unset to keep it off; delete the folder to remove any
captured files.

## No personal data, no tracking

Sonari does not collect personal information, does not use cookies or identifiers, does not
profile or track usage, and contains no analytics or third-party data processors.

## Removing your data

Run `sonari uninstall`, then delete the `~/.sonari/` folder. Uninstall alone
preserves `config.json`, `keymap.json`, and `state.json` (your session text) so
settings and unheard speech survive a reinstall — deleting `~/.sonari/` removes
everything, including that stored session content.

## Changes to this policy

Any changes will be committed to this file in the project repository, with the "Last updated"
date above revised accordingly.
