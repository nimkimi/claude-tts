"""End-to-end pipeline test: real hooks_entry -> real SpeechDaemon -> recording FakeSpeaker.

Proves the ordering contract from the design spec section 4:
  - a decision earcon fires IMMEDIATELY when the decision appears,
  - but the decision's spoken text is FIFO and is voiced only AFTER the
    preceding prose,
  - foreground gating works,
  - a turn_done earcon ends the turn.
No real audio is ever produced: the Speaker is replaced by a recorder.
